Sets the alternative text for all images in WordPress if not available.

== Description ==
The Image Alt Setter plugin automatically sets the alternative text for all images in WordPress if it is not available. Alternative text plays an essential role in web accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO), providing a description of the image content to users who may not be able to see the images. This plugin ensures that every image in your media library has descriptive alternative text, enhancing accessibility and improving your website's SEO. The plugin checks if the alt text is empty for each image and uses the image title as the alternative text if necessary.
